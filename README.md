## Overview of the analysis

## Purpose

To determine the number of current employees per their title, who are eligible for retirement, as well as determining current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Once the number of employees at eligible retirement age is determined we will know how many positions need to be filled. All employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 will be considered for a mentorship program, so employees who are close to retirement age can help prepare other employees to fill their positions
